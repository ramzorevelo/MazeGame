# Maze Game (C++ with SDL3)

This is a simple maze game written in C++ using SDL3. It is designed to help you practice and explore C++ programming by working on a real project.

The game features player movement, item collection, enemies, scoring, and win/loss conditions — all implemented in a way that is beginner-friendly and easy to modify.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022 (Community or higher)
- Windows 10 or 11
- No additional downloads required — SDL3 and SDL_ttf are already included in the project folder

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Get the Project Files

You have two options:

**Option A: Clone the repository (recommended)**

1. Open Visual Studio 2022
2. Go to **File > Clone Repository**
3. Copy and paste https://github.com/ramzorevelo/MazeGame.git
4. Choose a folder for the project
5. Click **Clone**

**Option B: Download ZIP**

1. Go to the GitHub repository page
2. Click **Code > Download ZIP**
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder
4. Open the folder

### 2. Open the Project

**If you cloned the repository (Option A):**

- Visual Studio will automatically open the project after cloning.
- If not, go to **File > Open > Project/Solution**, then open `MazeGame.sln` from the folder where you cloned the project.

**If you downloaded the ZIP (Option B):**

- Go to the folder where you extracted the ZIP.
- Double-click `MazeGame.sln` to open the project in Visual Studio 2022.

Once the project is open:

- Set the build configuration to **Debug**
- Set the platform to **x64** (not x86)

### 3. Build and Run

- Press **Ctrl + F5** to build and run the game (without debugging)
- The game window should open and run immediately

If you see any errors about missing DLLs, make sure the following files are in the same folder as the executable (`Debug` or `Release`):

- `SDL3.dll`
- `SDL3_ttf.dll`
- `font.ttf`

These are already included in the project and should copy automatically.

## Controls

- Arrow keys: Move the player
- Collect yellow items to earn points
- Avoid red enemies (you lose lives on contact)
- Reach the blue goal tile to win
- Running out of time or lives ends the game

## Customization Guide

You can change most of the game's settings and visuals from the file:

### `GameConfig.h`

Here are some examples of what you can modify:

```cpp
// Maze settings
inline const int TILE_SIZE = 64;
inline const int MAZE_WIDTH = 20;
inline const int MAZE_HEIGHT = 15;

// Game limits
inline const int PLAYER_LIVES = 3;
inline const int MAX_ITEMS = 5;
inline const int MAX_ENEMIES = 3;

// Colors
inline const SDL_Color COLOR_PLAYER_FILL = { 0, 200, 0, 255 };
inline const SDL_Color COLOR_ENEMY_FILL = { 255, 0, 0, 255 };

// Game speed
inline const Uint64 ENEMY_MOVE_INTERVAL = 500;
inline const Uint64 ITEM_MOVE_INTERVAL = 500;
```
You can also change the shape of entities (circle, triangle, diamond), the number of lives, score per item, speed of enemies/items, and more.

Maze Layout
In main.cpp, you can edit the maze layout using a 2D vector:

```cpp
std::vector<std::vector<int>> layout = {
    {0,0,0,0,0},
    {0,3,1,4,0},
    {0,1,0,1,0},
    {0,2,1,5,0},
    {0,0,0,0,0}
};
Each number represents a tile type:

0 = Wall
1 = Path
2 = Item
3 = Player start
4 = Goal tile
5 = Enemy
```
You can design your own maze here by changing the values.

## Suggested Experiments
Try modifying the game to:

- Change the player’s color or shape
- Add new enemies or items
- Change the maze layout
- Increase or decrease speed or time
- Make enemies follow the player
This is a great way to practice working with C++ classes, logic, and structure.

## Notes
- All SDL3 and SDL_ttf files are already included in the project folder.
- Do not delete the font.ttf or DLL files.
- If you want a different font style, you can search fonts through google, download any .ttf file and rename them to font.ttf and replace this file
- The project is set up to work out of the box on Windows using Visual Studio 2022.
